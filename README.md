# Hospital-DBDDD
For ISM4212, I created a database design using a Hospital Narrative provided. From the narrative, I created a SQL Server containing the completed database, data values, and queries.

Within this repository are the MDF and LDF files, PDF files containing the DBDD, Data Dictionary, and Join statements.
