# Hospital-DBDDD
For ISM4212, I created a database design using a Hospital Narrative provided. From the narrative, I created a SQL Server containing the completed database, data values, and queries.

Within this repository are PDF files containing the DBDD, Data Dictionary, Insert Statements, Join statements, and Single Table Select Statements. The MDF and LDF files are included.
